We can gather the courage to move through obstacles and blockages—individual, relational, and social—that may have seemed insurmountable previously.\r\n\r\nWe’re living in a period of rapid acceleration of social forces that threaten the survival of our planet, its creatures, and humanity. We all need more time and space in order to feel and respond with heart and skill to what is happening and to engage in lasting transformation from the inside out.\r\n\r\nGuided practice and study in group retreat is an important step to reconnect with the depth of our own innate wisdom and compassion that we can harness to create meaningful, sacred harmony and balance with the natural elements and to address social and environmental injustices.\r\n\r\nPlease join us in coming home to wisdom, embodied in the “mother of all the buddhas,” and inherent within each of us. The first two weeks we will practice and study the profound Prajnaparamita teachings.  For those who feel ready and interested, the third week we will and receive and learn the potent practice of Chöd (more information below).\r\n<h4>About  the  Program<img class=\"wp-image-39279 alignright\" src=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/drala-mountain-center-clouds-590x384.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"419\" height=\"273\" /></h4>\r\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">The Mahayana Summer Seminar at Drala Mountain Center is an immersion into the vast and profound Mahayana teachings of Buddhism. With a different theme each summer, we practice and study together in silent mornings with meditation and movement and in engaged afternoons with talks and group discussion, all in the invigorating beauty of the Rocky Mountains.</p>\r\nThis year, during the first two weeks of the Mahayana Summer Seminar, we will explore the Prajnaparamita teachings in a variety of ways, some more intuitive, some more analytical, some directly in meditation itself including working with pith instructions from the Sutra Mahamudra tradition.\r\n\r\nFor the final week, we’ll be joined by our dear friends Lama Alta Brown and David Soucy who will teach us the practice of the Surmang Chöd. Chöd is a ritual practice that enables us to cut through attachment for the purpose of healing personal blockages and working with environmental obstacles.\r\n\r\nIf this interests you, please read a more full description of Chöd practice <a href=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/program/ssc723chod/\">here</a>. See below for application options and links.\r\n\r\nThis will be our fifth year of the Summer Seminar. We have grown into a wonderful community and look forward to warmly welcoming new friends every year. All who are interested in these teachings are encouraged to attend. We craft each year’s seminar to be accessible entry points for first time participants while continuing to deepen and introduce new themes for returning participants.\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to apply for the following options.

It is not intended as an initial introduction to Buddhism or meditation, so some background is helpful. Please feel free to reach out to Loden at <a href=\"mailto:loden@dralamountain.org\">loden@dralamountain.org</a> for assistance in deciding whether the prajnaparamita portion is for you, and Dr. Lama Alta Brown at <a href=\"mailto:alta@everydaychod.com\">alta@everydayChöd.com</a> for assistance in deciding whether the Chöd portion is for you. The retreat is limited to 40 participants. We encourage early application (see links above) to ensure you get a spot.\r\n\r\n[su_divider top=\"no\" divider_color=\"#fbaf19\"]\r\n<h2>Registration Process</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two steps to the registration process: 1) Completing the questionnaire (see links above) and 2) Registering for lodging. You may register for lodging once you have been notified of acceptance into the retreat. The purpose of the questionnaire is to ensure the suitability of the retreat for each participant and to help the teaching team tailor the program to participant needs. Participants will be contacted soon after receipt of your completed questionnaire. If approved, you can then register for the program and lodging.</p>\r\n[su_divider top=\"no\" divider_color=\"#fbaf19\"]\r\n<h3>Lodging and Scholarship Information</h3>\r\n<strong>Lodging Recommendation</strong>\r\nWe recommend selecting lodging in the Red Feather Cabins or Tent options as these are closest to the Red Feather Campus, where the seminar will be held. Lodging rates have been reduced by 23 - 37% depending on lodging type.\r\n\r\nPlease review the <a href=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/about/policies/covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DMC COVID-19 policy</strong> </a>before completing registration.\r\n\r\n<strong>Scholarship Information</strong>\r\nClick <a href=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/about/policies/financial-aid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dralamountain.org/about/policies/financial-aid/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643737415167000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1n4EiTwNwuNjCDtMW1zr0U\">here</a> to learn more about Financial assistance and scholarships.  BIPOC individuals are encouraged to apply.  If you would like a scholarship, please indicate on the questionnaire (see links above). Once you have been confirmed, you will be instructed to apply for a scholarship.\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<strong>Covid Mitigation\r\n</strong>DMC and the teachers are committed to the health and well-being of all involved in this retreat. As COVID mitigation is a dynamic situation given new variants and developing treatments, we will determine our retreat protocols in consultation with medical professionals as the time of the retreat draws near. We will communicate those protocols in advance of the retreat. We can share now that the retreat is scheduled to be held in an open-air tent, which we hope will preclude a need for masking during talks, discussions, and meditation practice.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><u>Please note that the retreat’s ultimate mitigation protocols may be stricter than DMC’s center-wide protocols in place at the time of the retreat. </u>Accordingly, during the retreat you may come into contact with others who are not subject to the same protocols. Please keep this in mind if you select a shared housing option.</p>\r\n<em>Please review and understand <a href=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/about/policies/covid-19/\">Drala Mountain’s current COVID-19 policy </a>before visiting.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<strong>Heart Gift</strong>\r\nToward the end of your retreat you will be asked if you would like to make a heart gift to the teacher. In Shambhala and other wisdom cultures, people often make heart gifts to those who have made receiving precious teachings possible. The heart gift is purely optional and based on personal inspiration and gratitude. The amount is not important, just your inspiration to give, connect, and explore the cycles of generosity and offering. Gifts can be made by cash, check or Paypal.",

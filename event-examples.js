    "program_content": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><em>Ineffable Prajnaparamita, beyond thought and words,\r\n</em><em>Unborn, unceasing, the very essence of space,\r\n</em><em>The domain of discriminating awareness wisdom,\r\n</em><em>Mother of all buddhas, we pay homage to you.</em></p>\r\nThe true nature of our minds and hearts is the perfection of wisdom, known as <em>prajnaparamita</em>—the boundless, spacious, and wise love and compassion within all beings and reality itself.\r\n\r\nThe Buddha taught the Mahayana teachings on <em>prajnaparamita </em>to help us recognize and have confidence in our true nature, and to self-liberate the destructive emotions (<em>kleshas</em>) and conditioned patterns of actions (<em>karma</em>) which temporarily block access and create vicious cycles of suffering.\r\n\r\nAs the <em>Sadhana of Mahamudra</em> says, “<em>Good and bad, happy and sad, all thoughts vanish into emptiness like an imprint of a bird in the sky.</em>”\r\n\r\nWhen we recognize that our thoughts and emotions are not as solid as they appear, we are poised for healing and transformation. We can gather the courage to move through obstacles and blockages—individual, relational, and social—that may have seemed insurmountable previously.\r\n\r\nWe’re living in a period of rapid acceleration of social forces that threaten the survival of our planet, its creatures, and humanity. We all need more time and space in order to feel and respond with heart and skill to what is happening and to engage in lasting transformation from the inside out.\r\n\r\nGuided practice and study in group retreat is an important step to reconnect with the depth of our own innate wisdom and compassion that we can harness to create meaningful, sacred harmony and balance with the natural elements and to address social and environmental injustices.\r\n\r\nPlease join us in coming home to wisdom, embodied in the “mother of all the buddhas,” and inherent within each of us. We will practice and study the profound Prajnaparamita teachings.\r\n<h4>About  the  Program<img class=\"wp-image-39279 alignright\" src=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/drala-mountain-center-clouds-590x384.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"486\" height=\"316\" /></h4>\r\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">The Summer Seminar at Drala Mountain Center is an immersion into the vast and profound Mahayana teachings of Buddhism. With a different theme each summer, we practice and study together in silent mornings with meditation and movement and in engaged afternoons with talks and group discussion, all in the invigorating beauty of the Rocky Mountains.</p>\r\nThis year, during the first two weeks of the Summer Seminar, we will explore the Prajnaparamita teachings in a variety of ways, some more intuitive, some more analytical, some directly in meditation itself including working with pith instructions from the Sutra Mahamudra tradition.\r\n\r\nThis will be our fifth year of the Summer Seminar. We have grown into a wonderful community and look forward to warmly welcoming new friends every year. All who are interested in these teachings are encouraged to attend. We craft each year’s seminar to be accessible entry points for first time participants while continuing to deepen and introduce new themes for returning participants.\r\n\r\nSee below for information about the registration process.

It is not intended as an initial introduction to Buddhism or meditation, so some background is helpful. Please feel free to reach out to Loden at <a href=\"mailto:loden@shambhalamountain.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">loden@shambhalamountain.org</a> for assistance in deciding whether this is for you. The retreat is limited to 40 participants. We encourage early application (see link above) to ensure you get a spot.\r\n\r\n[su_divider top=\"no\" divider_color=\"#fbaf19\"]\r\n<h2>Registration Process</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two steps to the registration process: 1) Completing the questionnaire (see link above) and 2) Registering for lodging. You may register for lodging once you have been notified of acceptance into the retreat. The purpose of the questionnaire is to ensure the suitability of the retreat for each participant and to help the teaching team tailor the program to participant needs. Participants will be contacted soon after receipt of your completed questionnaire. If approved, you can then register for the program and lodging.</p>\r\n[su_divider top=\"no\" divider_color=\"#fbaf19\"]\r\n<h3>Lodging and Scholarship Information</h3>\r\n<h5>Lodging Recommendation</h5>\r\nWe recommend selecting lodging in the Red Feather Cabins or Tent options as these are closest to the Red Feather Campus, where the seminar will be held. Lodging rates have been reduced by 23 - 37% depending on lodging type.\r\n\r\nPlease review the <a href=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/about/policies/covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DMC COVID-19 policy</strong> </a>before completing registration.\r\n<h5>Scholarship Information</h5>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nClick <a href=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/about/policies/financial-aid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dralamountain.org/about/policies/financial-aid/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643737415167000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1n4EiTwNwuNjCDtMW1zr0U\">here</a> to learn more about Financial assistance and scholarships.  BIPOC individuals are encouraged to apply.  If you would like a scholarship, please indicate on the questionnaire (see links above). Once you have been confirmed, you will be instructed to apply for a scholarship.\r\n\r\n<strong>Covid Mitigation\r\n</strong>DMC and the teachers are committed to the health and well-being of all involved in this retreat. As COVID mitigation is a dynamic situation given new variants and developing treatments, we will determine our retreat protocols in consultation with medical professionals as the time of the retreat draws near. We will communicate those protocols in advance of the retreat. We can share now that the retreat is scheduled to be held in an open-air tent, which we hope will preclude a need for masking during talks, discussions, and meditation practice.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><u>Please note that the retreat’s ultimate mitigation protocols may be stricter than DMC’s center-wide protocols in place at the time of the retreat. </u>Accordingly, during the retreat you may come into contact with others who are not subject to the same protocols. Please keep this in mind if you select a shared housing option.</p>\r\n<em>Please review and understand <a href=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/about/policies/covid-19/\">Drala Mountain’s current COVID-19 policy </a>before visiting.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<strong>Heart Gift</strong>\r\n\r\nToward the end of your retreat you will be asked if you would like to make a heart gift to the teacher. In Shambhala and other wisdom cultures, people often make heart gifts to those who have made receiving precious teachings possible. The heart gift is purely optional and based on personal inspiration and gratitude. The amount is not important, just your inspiration to give, connect, and explore the cycles of generosity and offering. Gifts can be made by cash, check or paypal.",

The afternoons and evenings offer fun family activities like hiking, family yoga, dance, contemplative arts and crafts, games, storytelling, song night, and a talent show.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay in comfortable, platform tents among the fresh pine and fragrant summer breezes or enjoy indoor lodging with views of the unspoiled wilderness.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Children's Activities</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kids start the day with a morning session of activities,  from 9:15am to Noon. There are six age groups:<a href=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Painted-hands-kid.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-36105\" src=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Painted-hands-kid-590x391.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"348\" height=\"230\" /></a></span>\r\n\r\n<strong>      Name                       Ages</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Tigers                       3 to 5</li>\r\n \t<li>Lions                        6 to 7</li>\r\n \t<li>Garudas                   8 to 10</li>\r\n \t<li>Rites of Passage      9 to 10</li>\r\n \t<li>Dragons                  11 to 12</li>\r\n \t<li>Dharmic Warriors  13 to 18</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experiential activities include craft projects, time outdoors, stories, songs, hikes in the woods, and group games. Children are introduced to sitting meditation and meditative arts as ways to work with their hearts and minds. They are also introduced to the notion of basic goodness as a way to inspire intelligence, compassion, and confidence— all while having fun and developing friendships!</span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Please note:  </strong>The Tiger Cubs program for children aged 2 and under is not available this year due to COVID protocols and space limitations.\r\n<h3>* Rites of Passage (for children ages 9-10)</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This special program marks the transition children begin to make from being dependent on their parents to take on greater responsibility within the family and the community. Through sitting meditation, kyudo (Zen archery), ikebana (flower arranging), haiku, calligraphy, and other meditative arts, Rites of Passage gives children powerful tools to help them care for their own mind and emotions. These tools also empower them to relate to their internal and external worlds with confidence and gentleness. At the week’s end, this transformative program is sealed with a powerful ceremony in which the children take a vow of kindness towards themselves and others. There is an additional fee of $110 per child for Rites of Passage. </span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Family-Camp_-Wise-Kids_-515.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-21591 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Family-Camp_-Wise-Kids_-515.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"223\" height=\"303\" /></a></span>Attendance Requirements</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All children and at least one adult must attend at least 5 days of the 6-day program. Additional adults may attend less than the required 6 days. Full attendance helps support the community building of Family Camp, and allows participants to experience the beginning-middle-end journey of the camp— which is part of its magic! Rites of Passage children and their families need to stay through the conclusion of the program to participate in the Rites of Passage Ceremony. If you need to attend only a portion of the retreat, please register and select Personal Check. Then email frontdesk@dralamountain.org all family members' arrival and departure dates. We will adjust your dates and finances and contact you for payment.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please see this article about Family Camp on our blog: </span><a href=\"https://blog.shambhalamountain.org/family-camp-shambhala-mountain/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family Camp at Shambhala Mountain</span></a>\r\n<h2>Early Registration Recommended</h2>\r\nSpace for this program is limited due to COVID-19 precautions. If you have questions, we recommend you still register to the best of your ability to reserve your spot, and then we will sort out your questions. If you have questions after you register, email is the fastest way to receive a response: frontdesk@shambhalamountain.org. Please allow 3 business days for a response. Questions are addressed in the order they are received.\r\n\r\nA waitlist will be enlisted as soon as children's age groups begin to reach their capacity. Waitlisted families will be invited into the program based on time of registration and children’s age group availability.\r\n<h2>Public Health</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our COVID-19 policy requires overnight guests to provide proof of a negative antigen test taken within 24 hours of arrival, and to bring sufficient tests to test daily during the stay.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please read and understand </span><a href=\"https://www.shambhalamountain.org/about/policies/covid-19/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DMC’s current COVID-19 policy at this link</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n<h2>Registration Fees (payable to DMC)</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Registration fees include the Program Tuition and Lodging fees. Our regular room rates are discounted to make Family Camp more affordable. Initial housing costs shown include adult meals and lodging, as well as the 1st Adult’s $200 tuition. Tuition for the 2nd Adult ($200) and Child(ren) ($300 each) are added to the total as each individual is added to the registration. Children’s meals and lodging are included in their tuition cost. An additional fee of $110 per child is charged for Rites of Passage. Registration fees cover Drala Mountain Center’s operational costs of facilities, lodging, food, supplies, DMC support staff, and direct program expenses, including a base honorarium for the Family Camp Directors.</span>\r\n<h2>The Heart Fee (payable to Shambhala Families &amp; Children)</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many Family Camp teachers and program staff volunteer their expertise to create the magical container and experience of Family Camp. To show our deep appreciation for all their hard work, we collect a Heart Fee at the time of registration, prior to arrival at SMC. This is paid directly to Shambhala Families &amp; Children (a 501c3 legal entity of Shambhala) and can be paid via PayPal. One hundred percent of this fee goes towards both teaching and non-teaching program staff honoraria. (This fee takes the place of the heart gift, which was previously collected during the retreat.) The Heart Fee is our path towards reaching a sustainable family program — we appreciate your support of these dedicated leaders.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose ONE payment per family.</span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/crafting-kids.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-36107 alignright\" src=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/crafting-kids.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"355\" height=\"266\" /></a></span></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$100 – Jade</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$150 – Gold</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$200+ – Diamond</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other – Choose an amount that works for your family</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please offer from a place of generosity regardless of the amount. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complete this payment via PayPal to:  smcfamilycamp108@gmail.com</span></i>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do not have a PayPal account, please contact Steve Sachs at stevesachs108@gmail.com to make payment arrangements.</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PLEASE NOTE:  Drala Mountain Center does not process this fee.

    "program_content": "Vajrayana encourages intelligent, spacious involvement with all of life’s circumstances. Retreating with Evolving Ground will energize you for passionate activity in the world.\r\n\r\nOur contemporary Vajrayana practices invoke transformation and spontaneity. Vajrayana is a colorful, fiery path. Our practices engage the energy of emotions, rather than detaching from them. We train real world involvement, competence, and enjoyment—so the electric emotional texture of your experience becomes the fuel for responsive relationships.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.evolvingground.org/drala-schedule\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The program</a> is both supportive and challenging. All sessions are optional so you can pace yourself according to capacity. If this is your first retreat, you’ll have the option to increase your meditation hours in a safe, friendly space, taking a break when you need to. If you’re a seasoned meditator, you will find content and challenge for full-time, immersive engagement.\r\n\r\nYou’ll learn our life-affirming meditations and methods—and you’ll appreciate our perspectives and lively atmosphere. You’ll spend time deepening your silent practice, while meeting and forming friendships with others exploring contemporary Vajrayana.\r\n\r\nIf that floats your boat, we look forward to retreating with you!\r\n\r\n— Learn More: <a href=\"https://www.evolvingground.org/drala\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Retreat Details &amp; Schedule</a> | <a href=\"https://www.evolvingground.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Evolving Ground Website</a>\r\n<h2>Retreat Leaders</h2>\r\n<div><em>Evolving Ground Co-founders Charlie and Jared will lead this retreat.</em></div>\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n<strong>Charlie Awbery</strong>\r\n\r\nCharlie started their meditation journey in 1990, taking traditional Vajrayana ordination in 2002, and subsequently teaching Vajrayana students in private and group coaching. They’re passionate about making the tradition available in a straightforward way, working with the principle and function of methods without reliance on specific cultural forms. In 2018, Charlie stepped away from the traditional context to explore multiple approaches experientially and through <a href=\"https://deconstructingyourself.com/evolving-ground-with-rindzin-pamo-and-jared-janes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conversation with peers</a>.\r\n\r\n— Charlie writes as Rin’dzin Pamo at <a href=\"https://vajrayananow.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vajrayananow.com</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>Jared Janes</strong>\r\n\r\nJared has been meditating for a decade and has studied and practiced in multiple western spiritual approaches (mostly Buddhist). After meeting Charlie in 2019, he realized that the life-affirming nature found in Vajrayana was what had been missing in his practice. Jared is passionate about exploring the relationship between everyday life and the non-renunciative spiritual path.\r\n\r\n— Learn more about Jared at <a href=\"https://www.jaredjanes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JaredJanes.com</a>",

As Vajrayogini, meditators offer the visualization of their body to the beings they invite to three feasts. The feasts are the activity of the Buddha Vajrayogini. Through her activity, the energies of the “god-demons” are transmuted. The demons, whether negative emotions, illness, or hostile beings in other realms, are<img class=\"alignright wp-image-36237 size-smc-program\" src=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MachigHAR8363-V2-for-page-190x190.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"190\" height=\"190\" /> transformed into companions and friends. This is the ultimate practice of generosity. This is the magic of compassion. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This compassionate activity is so effective that it has been used for many centuries to heal mental illness in Tibetan communities. During periods of pandemic it was the Chöd practitioners who ministered to the sick and dying. You can learn more about Chöd practice at <a href=\"http://everydaychod.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EverydayChöd.com</a>.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chöd is also a Mahamudra practice. It can be practiced from the perspective of mahayana or vajrayana. For this reason, mahayana practitioners and vajrayana prac</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;\">titioners can </span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;\">practice together in the same practice situation.

In support of this, the retreat will provide a safe environment to address your core fears, mend old wounds, transform negative thinking, and find clarity around shaping the life and health you want.\r\n\r\nThe weekend will offer real connection and in-depth discussion while you identify and heal your personal habits of self-harm, self-rejection, and self-betrayal. You will also learn two very effective forms of self-care - mindfulness meditation and qi gong healing exercises - both of which will help unlock the stuck energy, blood, and emo\r\n\r\ntion that is keeping you unhappy, sick, or trapped.\r\n\r\nThis experience in the mountains will help you understand exactly how to stop hurting yourself, how to trust yourself, how to feel worthy, and how to finally enjoy your life without regret and without feeling guilty for wanting to be happy, well, and loved.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright wp-image-39829 \" style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: DroidSansRegular, sans-serif;\" src=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/drala-mountain-moose-590x478.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"365\" height=\"296\" />\r\n<h3><strong>Throughout this retreat, learn practical skills to:</strong></h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-list\">\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Move beyond self-doubt</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Remain present and solution-minded in the face of fear and uncertainty</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Identify the root causes of depression, anxiety, insecurity &amp; physical illness</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Overcome self-rejection and shame, and stop making yourself wrong</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Train your mind</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Heal past wounds, traumas &amp; habits of self-harm</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Transform limiting beliefs</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Clarify your direction forward</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Live more fully in the present</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Unlock stuck energy, blood &amp; subconscious emotion that is making you sick, unhappy or frustrated</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Forgive yourself &amp; others</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Understand your life’s purpose</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Improve your relationships</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Come home to the source of peace &amp; love within</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Revitalize your physical body &amp; health</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Stop blaming or punishing yourself</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Stop pretending to be happy or someone you are not</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><strong>Extend Your Stay</strong></h3>\r\nThis program ends at 6:30pm on Sunday.

    "program_content": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">From a spiritual perspective, death is the crowning moment of life. The karma that brought you into this life is exhausted, and the karma (habits) that will propel you into the next one hasn’t yet formed. This gap (bardo) provides a golden opportunity for rapid spiritual progress – if you are prepared. This week-long program gets you prepared. The luminous bardo of dharmata is where the peaceful and wrathful deities appear, which represent the archetypal aspects of your own mind. How can you meet those deities now? “Dharmata” means “suchness, reality” and refers to the enlightened state. All of manifest reality arises out of this bardo, and returns to it. It is the womb and the tomb of existence. Because of the subtle nature of this bardo, this program is more advanced. Some familiarity with the bardo teachings is recommended.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><a href=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/path.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-39409 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.dralamountain.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/path-590x422.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"422\" /></a></h5>\r\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 3 []\"><strong>Topics we will cover:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-list\">\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">How to remove all fear of death</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">How to help others at the end of life</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">The Tibetan Book of the Dead</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">The phases of the Bardo of Dharmata</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">The Reverse Meditations that prepare you for it</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">What continues after death ­– where do you go?</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">What doesn’t continue</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">How the power of mantra protects you</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Where near-death-experiences fit in</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">Contemplations and meditations that help you prepare</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">How dream yoga and sleep yoga help you prepare</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">The role of psychedelics in preparing to die</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">The problem of proof</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">How this bardo relates to nonduality and enlightenment</li>\r\n \t<li class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-listItem\" data-list-indent=\"1\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\">How this bardo manifests in daily life</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Who Should Attend?</h2>\r\nThis program is for anyone seriously wanting to prepare for the end of life. It is a no-nonsense deep dive into the profound teachings of Tibetan Buddhism. While it describes the spiritual preparation from a Buddhist perspective, the teachings are for anyone interested in a non-materialistic approach to death. This retreat is for those interested in exploring meditations that prepare you for death, and to “die before you die” — to discover states of mind that do not dissolve at the end of life. This program is also for those wishing to help others during the dying process, either personally or professionally, from both a spiritual and practical perspective.\r\n\r\n<em>This is a hybrid program and you are on the registration page to attend at your home, online.
